Problem Statement: Disaster management – Improving effciency of rescue missions

Abstract:Every year many people die as help does not arrive on time. This can be due to two main reasons: 
1. The rescue officers cannot identify the victims on time.
2. Due to destruction of surroundings, the rescue can be delayed as it is harder to reach victims.
To face this problem, we have come up with a solution to help improve the efficiency in such situations. We are planning to design an autonomous drone which can locate the victims’ position. Also it will map possible routes that can be taken for the rescue. 

Technical stats:
1 x F550 frame (Clone DJI Flame Wheel) with landing gear
3 x Hobbypower 2212 920KV Brushless motor CW
3 x Hobbypower 2212 920KV Brushless motor CCW
6 x HP Simonk 30A Speed Controller
1 x APM2.8 Flight controller
1 x NEO-7M GPS
2 x Gemfan 1045(CW+CCW) Black Propeller
1 x Gemfan 1045(CW+CCW) Orange Propeller
1 x GPS Bracket
The additional kit we purchased for the build are as follows:
Turnigy 9X Transmitter with Receiver Module
APM Power Module
5800mah 3s Lipo
 Berkeley Varitronics Systems Wolfhound Cellphone Detector 

Challenges: 
Durability of the drone during harsh conditions such as heavy winds
Battery life ( as our product will be computing a lot it will require more battery)
intereference of other frequencies
limited range, hence more than one needs to be deployed near area affected
can not be accessed by everyone due to government restrictions

How it works:During disasters, communication becomes a huge issue. This means that people cannot contact the authorities for help. But we do know that eventhough phones will not have connectivity, its reciever will still function. Hence we can utilise this by sending signals from drones. When the signal is recieved by the phone, it sends a return signal. As phones are owned by everyone, we make an assumption that a person is near the phone, hence drone will 
go near the reciever and scan the area through heat map. If the people are found, it’s next step will be to analyse the surroundings and map the possible route and send this information back to the.

Present tech:In India rescue missions are largely done by army officers, recent example of Kerala and Uttarakhand have shown that India still relies on traditional methods for rescue operations. 

How is this better than present day tech:
It is fully autonomous
Intelligent AI that can compute the possible solution for given problem
Saves lot of money when compared to search with helicopter
Can go to places where helicopter can not
  
Why this tech is needed:On August 2018 entire village was drowned due to flood in kodagu,karnataka. We believe if the rescue was done earlier we could have saved a lot of life.
